I've upgraded the wassup plugin to the latest version ( 1.5 ) and an error started to show in the pages:

{% highlight text %}
[ wp_wassup_tmp' doesn't exist ]
{% endhighlight %}

The solution is to deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it... witch should be the right way to upgrade your plugins.

**Update:**

I also get a syntax error from the wassup plugin, on the dashboard:

{% highlight text %}
***WordPress database error:*** [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'AND 1207656596' at line 1]
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT wassup_id) AS itemstot FROM wp_wassup WHERE wassup_id IS NOT NULL  AND timestamp BETWEEN  AND 1207656596
{% endhighlight %}

It seems that the errore comes from a debug query that was left in the wassupDashChart() function. To fix the error you need to comment two lines (1631,1632) of code in wassup.php:

{% highlight php linenos %}
// This is the function to print out a chart's preview in the dashboard
function wassupDashChart() {
  global $wpdb;
  $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . "wassup";
  $to_date = wassup_get_time();
  $Chart = New MainItems;
  $Chart->tableName = $table_name;
  $Chart->to_date = $to_date;

  //$itemstot = $Chart->calc_tot("count", $search, null, "DISTINCT");
  //print $itemstot;

  echo '<h3>WassUp Stats <cite><a href="admin.php?page=wassup">More Â»</a></cite></h3>';
  echo $Chart->TheChart(1, "400", "125", "", $wassup_options->wassup_chart_type, "bg,s,00000000", "dashboard", "left");
} //end function wassupDashChart
{% endhighlight %}
