I've upgraded the wassup plugin to the latest version ( 1.5 ) and an error started to show in the pages:

[ wp_wassup_tmp' doesn't exist ]

The solution is to deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it... witch should be the right way to upgrade your plugins.

**Update:**

I also get a syntax error from the wassup plugin, on the dashboard:

```{
***WordPress database error:*** [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'AND 1207656596' at line 1]
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT wassup_id) AS itemstot FROM wp_wassup WHERE wassup_id IS NOT NULL  AND timestamp BETWEEN  AND 1207656596
}```

It seems that the errore comes from a debug query that was left in the wassupDashChart() function. To fix the error you need to comment two lines (1631,1632) of code in wassup.php:

{% highlight php linenos %}
// This is the function to print out a chart's preview in the dashboard
function wassupDashChart() {
global $wpdb;
$table_name = $wpdb-&gt;prefix . "wassup";
$to_date = wassup_get_time();
$Chart = New MainItems;
$Chart-&gt;tableName = $table_name;
$Chart-&gt;to_date = $to_date;{% endhighlight %}

//$itemstot = $Chart-&gt;calc_tot("count", $search, null, "DISTINCT");
//print $itemstot;

echo '&lt;h3&gt;WassUp Stats &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="admin.php?page=wassup"&gt;More Â»&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;';
echo $Chart-&gt;TheChart(1, "400", "125", "", $wassup_options-&gt;wassup_chart_type, "bg,s,00000000", "dashboard", "left");
} //end function wassupDashChart
{% endhighlight %}
