I&#8217;ve been really busy the last months with the new job where we use c#. I&#8217;ve grown found to it &#8230; it has a lot of nice features &#8230; lambda expressions, anonymous types, generic types. Sure there are a lot of thing that can be improved like real generic types ( aka C++ templates ) but it&#8217;s a really reliable tool.

In the past I&#8217;ve worked on a few ASP.NET applications and I&#8217;ve not enjoyed it very much ( actually every time I&#8217;ve used it i promised myself not to use it again ) &#8230; until now. I&#8217;ve heard ofÂ  ASP.NET MVC witch is supposed to be a different way of developing web applications in .NET and after a few months of using it I can only say &#8230; ya baby &#8230; finally a nice way to use c# and .NET to do web apps.

If you get the chance give it a go&#8230; it&#8217;s worthed.
