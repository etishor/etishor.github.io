I used to use [Coppermine Photo Gallery][1] for [http://gallery.erata.net][2] but today i&#8217;ve decided to close it down. The number of vulnerabilities ( most of them critical ) discovered over the years got me thinking. You can see what i mean here [http://www.milw0rm.com/search.php?dong=coppermine][3]. 3 vulnerabilities found in the first two months of 2009.Â  4 in 2008. This remembers me of sendmail and bind ( witch I&#8217;ve heard got better but who cares about them anymore ).

I know it&#8217;s not written in stone but from the number of vulnerabilities i deduce the quality of a pice of software. I also understand open-source &#8230; and open-source brings a lot more peer reviews &#8230; and i don&#8217;t mind (that much) vulnerabilities in pre 1.0 versions. But after a few years of development and after a few critical vulnerabilities i&#8217;d expect a product to get better and safer.

Oh well&#8230; good luck to the developers of coppermine keeping their users safe.

Alternatives i consider using for web gallery needs:

- [Picassa][4] &#8211; if it&#8217;s enough for the job works very well, provides desktop application for management and until proven wrong i belive it&#8217;s safe ( and if it&#8217;s not i don&#8217;t worry to much since it does not run on my server )

- [WordPress][5] with [NextGen Gallery][6] plugin &#8211; can be greatly customized and works well and also allows other content posting.
