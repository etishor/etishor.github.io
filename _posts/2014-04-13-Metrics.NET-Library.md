For the past couple of weeks I've been working on a new pet project, a .NET port of [Coda Hale's Metrics library](http://metrics.codahale.com/).

The [Metrics.NET](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET) library provides a way of instrumenting applications with custom metrics (timers, historams, counters etc) that can be reported in various ways and can provide insights on what is happening inside a running application. 

The library is published on NuGet can be installed with the following command:

    Install-Package Metrics.NET

Supported runtimes: .NET 4.5.1, .NET 4.5, .NET 4.0, Mono 3.4.0 ( tested on OsX ).

The API of the library might change until a 1.X version will be made available.

Documentation:

* [Available Metrics](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/Available-Metrics)
* [Metric Visualization](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/Metrics-Visualization)
* [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/)

###Quick Usage Sample

```csharp
public class SampleMetrics
{
    private readonly Timer timer = 
      Metric.Timer("Requests", SamplingType.FavourRecent, Unit.Requests);

    public void Request(int i)
    {
     	// measure until disposed
        using (this.timer.NewContext()) 
        {
            // do some work
        }
    }
}
```
