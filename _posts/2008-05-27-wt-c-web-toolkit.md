[Wt][1] (pronounced 'witty') is a C++ library and application server for developing and deploying web applications. It is not a 'framework', which enforces a way of programming, but a library.


I've found myself a new toy :). No more php or C# or ASP or other things i don't like to use but i have to use. I haven't yet started to use Wt, but looks nice. Like it or not the web-app is competing really well with the native-app, at least from the desktop user's point of view. It would be nice to have a way of writing web apps with things like type safety, generic code and most important reusing libraries like boost.

From the first look at the Wt code i looks somehow familiar, maybe because I've used Qt a lot and the Wt's slot/signal mechanism seems similar.

A C++ library that allows creation of a web graphical interface by using widgets rather than hand written html. Sounds wonderful. I can only hope it will raise up to the expectations.

More after a play with it.
