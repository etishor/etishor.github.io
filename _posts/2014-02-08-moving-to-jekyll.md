With hope that this will also mean writing more often, I've finaly decided to move to a modern blogging platform.


### Moving away from Wordpress

Wordpress is a very mature blogging platform, full of extraordinary features. You get automatic updates, easy updates for 
plugins, nice interface to manage the whole thing and a lot of freely available plugins & themes.

Why move away from this?

It requires hosting, it is kinda slow and it is not exactly low ceremony.

### Why Jekyll

* You get to host it for free on github pages. 
* You get to write markdown.
* You get full control over the theme.
* You are free to use modern web technologies.
* You get to manage content with GIT.
* It's very low ceremony - write, commit & push to publish.
