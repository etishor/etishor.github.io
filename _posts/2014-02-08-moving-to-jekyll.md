With hope that this will also mean writing more often, I've finally decided to move to a modern blogging platform.

### Moving away from Wordpress

Wordpress is a mature blogging platform, full of extraordinary features. You get automatic updates, easy updates for 
plugins, nice interface to manage the whole thing and a lot of available plugins & themes.

Why move away from this?

It requires hosting, it is kinda slow and it is not exactly low ceremony.

### Why [Jekyll][1]

* You get to host it for free on [Github pages][2]. 
* You get to write markdown.
* You get full control over the theme.
* You are free to use modern web technologies.
* You get to manage content with GIT.
* It's low ceremony - write, commit & push to publish.

### Update

I've finished migrating posts, and content to Jekyll. Even if some of the content required manual fiddling, it has not been a difficult experience. Now waiting for Google Webmaster's Tools to tell me what I've screwed up.

One thing I've noticed is that my blog now is blazing fast - which is normal, considering it's just a bunch of static web pages hosted on Github.
