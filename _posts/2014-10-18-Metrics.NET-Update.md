Since March, i've been working on this Metrics.NET library. I'm using it in a few production projects 
and i've become addicted to having everything measured and having the metrics information available
when making decisions. Especialy when writing systems that are asyncronous where it's difficult to rely
only on logging for understanding what is going one. 

#### What it is
Metrics.NET library is a .NET Port, with lots of additional functionality, of the awesome Java [metrics library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) by Coda Hale.

To paraphrase the Java library description - Metrics is a library which gives you unparalleled insight into what your code does in production. Metrics provides a powerful toolkit of ways to measure the behavior of critical components in your production environment.

The full description and documentation is available on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki).

Any feedback, especialy on the public API of the library would be appreciated.
